        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          ightning Law was born in Seattle in 2017 right here, on this
          conference room table, when one lawyer decided to save trees by using
          scanned exhibits instead of paper ones. That lawyer, and others
          present, were surprised to find that the deposition went much faster
          than normal. This is a picture of that deposition, showing an
          uncluttered nearly paper free conference room table during a
          “paperless deposition.”
        </p>

        <h4>
          Suddenly,traveling to depositions became a lot “lighter,” armed with
          thumb drives instead of bankers’ boxes.
        </h4>

        <p>
          But the system was still far from perfect, not only for lawyers but
          also for court reporters. Lawyers wanted to spend more time with their
          families and less time on the road traveling to obtain testimony.
          Court Reporters wanted to be paid not only for their appearances but
          for their transcripts. Everyone seemed to be worried about a pending
          court reporter shortage. Lightning law was created to deliver remote,
          travel free testimony in a platform that ensures prompt payment for
          transcripts to Court Reporter. We deliver free rough transcripts to
          free up Court Reporters to make more appearances and to give lawyers
          access to testimony as quickly as possible.
        </p>

      <section class="our-goal"> 
        <h3>Our Goal</h3>
        <p>deliver remote in trial testimony. The administration of justice is a search for the truth. We find that the typical jury only hears part of the truth. A jury will hear only the testimony that that attorneys can deliver during trial. Witnesses who are far away or too busy do not testify. We would like to change</p>
        <h4>difference for all litigants.</h4>
        <p>Remote in Court testimony can deliver essential translators, can allow in Court appearances for litigants who cannot otherwise afford to be there and can effectively open the courthouse doors to those who might otherwise never “step foot” in it. Along the way, Lightning Law can deliver testimony to mediators and Judges and focus groups so that more cases can be resolved more often. More justice brings more light.</p>
