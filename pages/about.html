      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        We created Lightning law to increase access to evidence, to make the search for justice faster and more
        efficient and to lighten the burden on our Courts. Lightning Law was created to solve the problems frequently
        encountered by attorneys and court reporters, such as, difficulty scheduling depositions, expensive travel,
        heavy boxes of paper exhibits and long delays in payment for appearances and transcripts. One day, we hope to
        delivery lightning fast remote testimony in the Courtroom and around the world.

          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Lightning Law was born in Seattle in 2017 right here, on this
            conference room table, when one lawyer decided to save trees by using
            scanned exhibits instead of paper ones. That lawyer, and others
            present, were surprised to find that the deposition went much faster
            than normal. This is a picture of that deposition, showing an
            uncluttered nearly paper free conference room table during a
            “paperless deposition.”
          </p>

          <h4>
            Suddenly,traveling to depositions became a lot “lighter,” armed with
            thumb drives instead of bankers’ boxes.
          </h4>

          <p>
            But the system was still far from perfect, not only for lawyers but
            also for court reporters. Lawyers wanted to spend more time with their
            families and less time on the road traveling to obtain testimony.
            Court Reporters wanted to be paid not only for their appearances but
            for their transcripts. Everyone seemed to be worried about a pending
            court reporter shortage. Lightning law was created to deliver remote,
            travel free testimony in a platform that ensures prompt payment for
            transcripts to Court Reporter. We deliver free rough transcripts to
            free up Court Reporters to make more appearances and to give lawyers
            access to testimony as quickly as possible.

      <h3>Our Goal</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Our goal is to master the remote deposition so that we can deliver remote in trial testimony. The
        administration of justice is a search for the truth. We find that the typical jury only hears part of the truth.
        A jury will hear only the testimony that that attorneys can deliver during trial. Witnesses who are far away or
        too busy do not testify. We would like to change that by streaming testimony into courtrooms.</p>
      <h4>Along the way, we see ways to make a difference for all litigants.</h4>
      <p>Remote in Court testimony can deliver essential translators, can allow in Court appearances for litigants who
        cannot otherwise afford to be there and can effectively open the courthouse doors to those who might otherwise
        never “step foot” in it. More justice brings more light.</p>
